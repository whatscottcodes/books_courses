    "Quick word on **reassignment**...we have already seen that you can assign a value to a variable and then later assign a different value, effectively rewritting the assigned value of the variable. Python uses the equal sign for this (=), but that does not mean it works the same way as it does in mathematics. For example, a=7 does not imply 7=a and just because a=b now, does not mean the value of a will always equal the value of b.\n",

    "In Python, an assignment statement can make two variables equal, but they don’t have to stay that way. In the code below the third line changes the value of a but does not change the value of b , so they are no longer equal.\n",
