# READ ME

## Purpose

This directory contains projects, code, data, and notes from some courses and books I've worked through. Some off these scripts and notebooks have been uploaded to my github before and subsequently removed as I have rebooted my github a few times for various reasons.

They have been recently checked to ensure the notebooks are documented and everything is working as intended. Some of the project/code contain my own answers to provided problems, others are a workthrough of probided examples. Feel free to use anything you need and I'm open to questions, comments, or criticisms. 

The current books/courses are;

+ MITxEDX's Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python
+ MITxEDX's Introduction to Computational Thinking and Data Science
+ Andrew Ng's Machine Learning
+ thinkPython
+ thinkStats
+ Python Data Science Handbook
+ An Introduction to Statistical Learning

    *all code in python*

Thanks for stopping by.
